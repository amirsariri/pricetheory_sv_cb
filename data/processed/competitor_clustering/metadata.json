          "description": "You've seen it before - you go to a freelance website and bid on a project.  It cost you some money, but that's okay, because you're confident that your skill and proposal will get you the bid.  A couple days later, your bid isn't chosen, because someone else who is far less qualified got the job just because they can undercut your price.  Thought:  What if you had to pay for every bid you placed?  That would reduce the amount of SPAM bidders who bid on every project.  But what about the cost to you?  You've ALSO seen websites where you do have to bid on projects.  Sure it makes for a quality control, but 10 bids later at a crazy amount of money per bid, you're broke and didn't get a single job.  Solution:  You have to pay for a bid, but if you don't win the job, you get your money back.  Doesn't that seem simple?  IT IS!  What we do:  You get charged a small monthly membership, at which point you are entitled to make a certain amount of bids as part of your membership.  If you don't win a project, you get refunded the bid cost.  If you win the project, you don't get your bid money back.  Do you have a job you want to post?  For the same monthly membership, you can post a certain amount of projects every month.    How do we make money on this:  Once the project poster selects a winning bidder (not always the highest or lowest, but the best proposal), we take a small percentage of the final agreed upon price.  Why does this work:  Your project is posted with the rest after being carefully looked over to make sure it meets standards and quality control.  Then our group of prospective freelancers, whom we have already qualified and verified as authentic job seekers, bid on your project.  Detailed proposals are given, and a price is set which they believe they can fulfill your project needs.   Everyone is qualified and verified before they are even added to the system, project posters and freelancers alike."
